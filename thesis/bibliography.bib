  abstract       = {The most common imaging methods used in dentistry are X-ray imaging and RGB color photography. However, both imaging methods provide only a limited amount of information on the wavelength-dependent optical properties of the hard and soft tissues in the mouth. Spectral imaging, on the other hand, provides significantly more information on the medically relevant dental and oral features (e.g. caries, calculus, and gingivitis). Due to this, we constructed a spectral imaging setup and acquired 316 oral and dental reflectance spectral images, 215 of which are annotated by medical experts, of 30 human test subjects. Spectral images of the subjects’ faces and other areas of interest were captured, along with other medically relevant information (e.g., pulse and blood pressure). We collected these oral, dental, and face spectral images, their annotations and metadata into a publicly available database that we describe in this paper. This oral and dental spectral image database (ODSI-DB) provides a vast amount of data that can be used for developing, e.g., pattern recognition and machine vision applications for dentistry.},
